===== DMN Examples

*Working with Variables*
====
- Using the `Expression` input to evaluate an Object(JSON or Java)

NOTE: The Expression field is evaluated using FEEL and `.` operator is utilized to access the value of `submission.reviewSchedule`. The `submission` object is stored in Camunda process variables as JsonValue type.  DMN knows how to work with this type. See more about the [JsonValue type]
