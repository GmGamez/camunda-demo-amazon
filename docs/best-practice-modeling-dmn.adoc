==== Working with Variables
====
*Using the `Expression` input to evaluate an Object (JSON or Java)*

NOTE: The Expression field is evaluated using FEEL and `.` operator is utilized to access the value of `submission.reviewSchedule`. The `submission` object is stored in Camunda process variables as JsonValue type.  DMN knows how to work with this type. See more about the [JsonValue type]

*Passing variables through a DMN*
```

```

=== Working with Dates
Working with dates in Camunda can be tricky. There are different date formats to consider and different date types that also come into play.

====
*Date Formats and Date Types and where they apply*

- java.util.Date
- LocalDateTimeVal
- LocalDateVal

====

====
*Date formats best practice*

* Use DateTime with timezone
* Camunda process variable format(java.util.Date) vs Feel DateTime Format
