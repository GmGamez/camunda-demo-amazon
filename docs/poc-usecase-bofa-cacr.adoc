=== Summary
The purpose of the workshop is to discuss architecture, infrastructure, Camunda concepts and to generally enable the BofA team to create a common workflow system for multiple use cases with BofA.

=== Goals
- [x] Discuss architectural concepts related to Infra, Design, Modeling and Patterns
- [x] Understand how Camunda, BPMN and DMN fit into overall architecture
- [x] Understand Optimize and reporting with Camunda
- [ ] Deep dive modeling BPMN to bring a particle understanding between BPMN and overall architecture
- [ ] Understand equivalent features and functionality with PEGA

//=== Integrations

//===== Google Pub/Sub and Channel Adapter Workflow Integration
//====
//Google Pub/Sub *publishing* integration from the Camunda perspective is implemented through <<patterns-for-integration, Java Delegates>> or <<patterns-for-integration, Execution Listerners>> and Java code executed in the workflow execution context.
//
//Camunda BPMN Message Receive events are also utilized in the workflow context to receive messages from the pub/sub.
//
//Abstraction from the workflow implementation and the pub/sub framework is accomplished through the *Channel Adapter* concept. The channel adapter concept utilizes HTTP to publish to the workflow Message Receive API and the workflow Camunda Delegates and/or excution listeners will utilize HTTP to publish to the channel adapters.

//=== See It Running
//A portion of the PoC was dedicating to building and running an environment specific to American Family and is not documented in this document. Though many of the steps and examples are documented. See the section below for concepts about running these environments and the specifics for Camunda.
//
//Additionally, we spent time running with Docker Tomcact Image and Spring-Boot for local development.
//
//===== Running Local Dev
//- <<example-camunda-docker-tomcat,Run the Camunda Tomcat Docker Image>>
//- <<example-camunda-docker-springboot,Run Camunda Spring-Boot with Docker>>
//- <<example-camunda-helm,Run Camunda HELM>>
//- <<best-practice-securing-db-connection,Configuring a SSL/TLS connection from Camunda application to Postgres Database>>
